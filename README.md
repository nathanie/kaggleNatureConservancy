# kaggleNatureConservancy

the labels_* files contain annotations for all corresponding image files 
* some files contain more than one fish - only the most dominant fish was annotated
the first point is always for the head, the second point is for the tail
the annotations were made with the idea of cropping the fish prior to learning its type - 
suggested margins for the crops are 10% for the long axis and 50% to each of the sides (creating a square)
if the fish was partly hidden the last seen spot was annotated
